**Description**

The given text describes a list of .csv files containing integer values of heart noise amplitudes, separated by ";", recorded over several seconds with a sampling frequency of 1000Hz (the numbers in the record denote the signal amplitude, and the time interval between adjacent values is 1 millisecond). For each file previously sent, a list of triples t1, t2, t3 needs to be output, where t1 is the start, t2 is the point of maximum amplitude, and t3 is the end of "tone 1" for each of the heart cycles. The result is to be displayed on the screen. The task is performed in Python.

**Testing**

Example execution of the task for one of the files according to Figure 1.
